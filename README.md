You can contribute to this dataset in the following ways:

- **Pull Requests**: Submit multiple designs or large changes via pull requests, provided you have reviewed all new designs and ensured they are ready to be archived.

- **Take a role**: You can help maintain this dataset. Check available roles in [05_responsibility.md](_docs/en/05_responsibility.md). When people work together and keep things steady, we can do much more. Step in, help out, and build great projects.
