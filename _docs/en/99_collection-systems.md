# Collection Systems Catalogue (WIP)

This is a catalogue for collection systems. It is independent from the main catalogue because collection systems often tie to specific (types of) farms, and may be designed under different philosophies. So a design could have multiple available collection systems, which is not conveniently represented in the main catalogue.

The licenses, management, and contribution guidelines are the same as the main catalogue. Check [here](../../README.md) for details.
