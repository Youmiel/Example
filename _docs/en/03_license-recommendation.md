# License Recommendation

> ### Notice
> 
> Please be aware that once you apply these public licenses and share your work, they have a few important and lasting effects:
> 
> 1. **You cannot take it back.** The license is **irrevocable**. People who already received your work under the license can keep using it under those terms.
> 2. **You cannot change the rules later.** You cannot apply a different license to the **same copy** of the work that someone already has.
> 3. **The rights last as long as the work is used.** The core conditions (like giving you credit) apply for as long as others use your work.
> 
> So, **think carefully before choosing**, because your decision is effectively permanent for that version of your work.

The licenses are divided into three categories: **recommended, acceptable, conflicting**. Each recommendation is accompanied with a brief reasoning. The referenced summary texts are taken from [TLDRLegal](https://tldrlegal.com/) under CC BY 3.0 license.

## Recommended

- **CC BY 4.0**: aligned with this dataset's license, only requiring attribution. Version 4.0 is preferred due to its improvement in international compatibility and clarity over previous versions.

- **MIT License, BSD-2/3-Clause, Apache 2.0**: the most permissive software licenses (if you believe the contraption designs are source code), allowing nearly unrestricted use (including commercial/closed-source), only requiring attribution and disclaiming warranties. 
  > **MIT:** A short, permissive software license. Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source.  There are many variations of this license in use.

  > **BSD-2-Clause:** The BSD 2-clause license allows you almost unlimited freedom with the software so long as you include the BSD copyright notice in it. Many other licenses are influenced by this one.

  > **BSD-3-Clause:** The BSD 3-clause license allows you almost unlimited freedom with the software so long as you include the BSD copyright and license notice in it. 

  > **Apache 2.0:** You can do what you like with the software, as long as you include the required notices. This permissive license contains a patent license from the contributors of the code.

- **CC0** (public domain): the most open license, but **be aware that the author must explicitly waive all rights**.
  > Releases software into the public domain, or otherwise grants permission to use it for any purpose. Disclaims patent licenses.


## Acceptable

- **CC BY-SA 4.0:** technically acceptable, but "share alike" clauses **require any derivative works to be licensed under the same license**, which may complicate mixing with other works.
  > Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license in International version 4, that allows to do what they want with your work as long as they share the work under the same licence.

- **CC BY-NC 4.0:** technically acceptable, but **"non-commercial" is vague and may limit use cases** (e.g., use in a monetized video).
  > Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license in International version 4, that allows to do what they want with your work as long as it`s Non Commercial.

- **Copyleft licenses** (GPL, LGPL, AGPL, etc.): technically acceptable, if you believe the contraption designs are source code. However, the strong copyleft clauses **require any derivative works to be licensed under the same license**, which may complicate mixing with other works. Additionally, **whether redstone designs can be considered as libraries or network software (for LGPL and AGPL respectively) is debatable**.
  > **GPL v3:** You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL along with build & install instructions.

  > **LGPL v3:** This license is mainly applied to libraries. You may copy, distribute and modify the software provided that modifications are described and licensed for free under LGPL. Derivatives works (including modifications or anything statically linked to the library) can only be redistributed under LGPL, but applications that use the library don't have to be.

  > **AGPL v3:** The AGPL license differs from the other GNU licenses in that it was built for network software. You can distribute modified versions if you keep track of the changes and the date you made them. As per usual with GNU licenses, you must license derivatives under AGPL. It provides the same restrictions and freedoms as the GPLv3 but with an additional clause which makes it so that source code must be distributed along with web publication. Since web sites and services are never distributed in the traditional sense, the AGPL is the GPL of the web.

- **CC BY-NC-SA:** with both "non-commercial" and "share alike" clauses, this license has the same issues as above.
  > This creative commons license is based on version 4.0 of the creative commons attribution license.
  >
  > It additionally prevents commercial use and requires any derivates to use the same license.
  > 
  > It also doesn't allow Tivoization and provides protection from defamation for the creator.

## Conflicting

- **All Rights Reserved (ARR)**: forbids redistribution entirely without explicit permission from the author, making archiving impossible.
- **CC BY-ND:** "no derivatives" clause forbids redistribution in this dataset.
- **CC BY-NC-ND:** "non-commercial" and "no derivatives" clauses further restrict use and redistribution.
- **Any custom, vaguely-defined non-standard license:** these licenses may impose additional restrictions or ambiguities that complicate use and redistribution.
