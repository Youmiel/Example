## Acceptance Criteria

We accept all levels of works, as long as it has original contents and meets below criteria.

- **Originality**: regardless of how much technology is involved, designs must be original or properly credited if **based on** others' work.

    > **based on** vs **adapted from**: "based on" means the design is an original extension to another work, while "adapted from" indicates only minor changes without significant functional improvements. (But adapted works can still be archived as an additional item to the original work, if it is valuable.)

(storage system)

- **Technical Details**: descriptions should include core technical details to understand its functionality, or core improvements over existing designs.

- **License**: all submissions must be under a compatible license (recommended licenses can be found here: [03_license-recommendation.md](03_license-recommendation.md)).


If you are not the original creator of the design, additional guidelines apply:

- **Authorship**: For archiving and redistribution, you must get permission and a license from the original creator. **If the work already has an open license, no further permission is needed.**


If you are contributing via Pull Requests, additional guidelines apply:

- **File Structure**: Ensure that new items, contraptions and designs follow the established file structure.
- **One PR solves one issue**: Each pull request should only related to a single affair (e.g. bulky submission, restructure, document change).
