# Migration Guide

There are many other TMC archives, if one day an archive is to be merged into this catalogue, the following guide may help.

1. **Formats and structures:** all entries should follow the format and structure defined in this catalogue. This may require moving files around, renaming files or folders, and converting file formats.

2. **Licenses:** all designs should have appropriate licenses to ensure they are compatible with the catalogue's licensing policy. If not, seek permission from the original authors or exclude those designs.

3. **Review:** during migration, automated tools can be used to convert formats and structures, but final review by humans is essential to ensure accuracy and completeness.

The migraction is not an easy task, and may require significant effort depending on the size and complexity of the source archive. We respect the work of other archivists, and recommend contacting them for advice or collaboration during the migration process.
